									<p>Compare the rules of the GDPR - in particular, with relation to the securing of personal data rule, with either similar compliance laws within your country of residence, or with the ICO in the UK.</p>

<h2>Initial Post</h2>	
<p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). is an EU wide initiative that came into effect on 28th May 2023. It is a legislative framework that protects individuals’ personal data, ensuring lawful processing. The ICO is an independent supervising authority in the UK that ensures compliance with data laws, in the UK data protection laws are covered by the Data protection Act 2018 (DPA), which incorporates provisions from GDPR.<p>
<p>The UKs decision in 2016 to leave the European Union had implications for Data protection. It resulted in the formation of an amended Data Protection Act in 2019, to reflect the change in legal status. </p>
<p>In an ever more connected world, there is a growing concern amongst civilians is how their data is processed and potential for misuse. Examples of which include the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018 whereby millions of Facebook users had their personal information accessed and used for political targeting adverts without their consent. Both the DPA and GDPR guidance explicitly address these concerns through purpose limitation clauses in which the data handlers most explicitly the purpose and intent behind handling and individuals’ data, many organisations have taken additional steps such as employing Data Protection Officers (DPO) and conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPAIs) – decisions to make such appointments will often depend on the volume and sensitivity of the information being handled, for example, in NHS trusts. </p>
<p>One key area in which the UK’s DPA makes further requirements in the form of maintaining detailed internal records on personal data processing, the preparation of data protection impact assessments and clearer privacy notices informing users of how their data will be used. The EU in response has adopted two “adequacy” decisions in 202, determining that the UK data laws are sufficient to protect a person’s data to the standard required by GDPR.</p>

<h2>Peer led feedback</h2>
<p>Upon reflection with comments from my Peers, I found it interesting to learn about a variety of further studies that has been conducted into the large-scale studies including the institutional review body who highlighted the importance of addressing furture commercial use at the point of initial consent. Additionally, it was pointed out that organisations should also consider the source of the data and whether it is protected or publicly available and how this will alter potential usage of the data.</p>
<p>The initial post also received feedback on how further specifics could be incorporated into the how the DPA and GDPR rules differ, with some interesting studies quoted. Lloyd (2022) which commented on the incoming introduction of guideline B-13 and its importance for further security and cyber risk management.</p>									
<p>Through reflecting on posts made by my peers I also gained insight into how other countries Data protection rules differ from the UK, including the BDSG system in Germany which encompasses both private individuals retaining data and organisations processing personal data.</p>								</div>
<h2>Summary post</h2>							
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive EU-wide initiative that took effect on May 28, 2023. This legislative framework is designed to safeguard individuals' personal data by ensuring its lawful processing. To oversee compliance with data protection laws, the UK established the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) as an independent supervisory authority. In the UK, data protection is governed by the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA), which integrates key provisions from the GDPR.</p>							
<p>The GDPR is an essential step towards safeguarding personal data and upholding individuals' privacy rights. It establishes a standardized approach to data protection across the EU and beyond, fostering trust between individuals and organizations in the digital era. The ICO plays a crucial role in enforcing these regulations, ensuring data protection remains a top priority for businesses and organizations operating in the UK.</p>							
<p>Privacy of individuals data is becoming an every growing concern in our more digitally connected world. Notable scandals including Cambridge Analytica in 2018, where millions of Facebook users had their data obtained and used without their consent have led to a surge in concern about how personal data is obtained, stored and used. Subsequent reports into the scandal such as Hinds et.al 2020 found that many individuals find online privacy rules confusing and lack understanding of the risks associated with their personal data networks. Additionally, advice was provided by schneble et.al (2018) to the Institutional review board to consider initial informed consent for organisations planning on using personal data for commercial reasons.</p>							
<p>Both the Data Protection Act (DPA) and GDPR provide explicit guidance addressing concerns related to data handling. They include purpose limitation clauses, which require data handlers to clearly state the purpose and intention behind processing individuals' data. Many organizations have taken additional measures, such as appointing Data Protection Officers (DPO) and conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPAIs). The decision to appoint such officers depends on the amount and sensitivity of data being handled, particularly evident in NHS trusts.</p>							
<p>The UK's DPA goes further in certain aspects, necessitating the maintenance of detailed internal records on personal data processing, preparing data protection impact assessments, and providing clearer privacy notices to inform users about data usage. In response, the EU has made two "adequacy" decisions in 2023, affirming that the UK's data laws sufficiently protect individuals' data to meet the GDPR standards</p>
