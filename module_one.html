									<p> Critically evaluate the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT), in the context of the article by Huxley et al (2020), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection.</p>
<h2>Initial post</h2>
<p>The internet of things incorporates an array of systems and devices and has revolutionised the way in which we can use data to drive decision making on both an individual and commercial level. The multifaceted stream processing pathways allow both individual safety/ monitoring information and strategic decision making on a wider scale through hot and cold pathways respectively; in addition to self-iterating improvements through machiene learning.1 </p>
<p>It has long been established that rigorous data cleaning is a fundamental principal underpinning the quality of big data analysis, as demonstrated by Lomet et al. back in 2000 where the need to cover schema-and instance-related data transformations in an integrated way was highlighted.2 This notion has been built upon by chu et al. where failure to clean data adequately can result in inaccurate analysis and poor decision making, the scale of this problem has been highlighted by the growing interest of the industry in both qualitative techniques including use constraints, rules, or patterns to detect errors, as well as more state-of-the-art techniques through machiene learning and probalistic data cleaning.3</p>									
<p>A significant limitation of data produced from the internet of things is the often-disorganised nature for example when dealing with audio and video data entry files – this can increase the latency of analytics as pre-processing is required. It is therefore imperative that adequate investment in streaming pipelines is made to filtering aggregate and prepare the data.1 </p>
<p>A further complication alluded to by Huxley et al. is the subjective necessity of individual expertise in the data cleaning process. She describes the process as “not a purely objective task” and despite recent advancements in AI and machiene learning, there still remains the expensive and time-consuming requirement of a human centred subjective approach.4 </p>								
<p>In many organisations the data cleaning process will be a collaborative effort, it is therefore imperative that contributors are aware of the methodology and timeframe of the process; Huxley further describes how this can be assured through the maintenance of accurate documentation at each step of the process.4</p>								
<p>To summarise the Internet of things represents a new frontier in a better connected, data driven world; it also however presents the challenge of striking a balance between sheer data volume and data quality – a challenge that can be overcome with a rigorous data cleaning strategy to ensure efficiency and more assured decision making.  </p>

<h2>Peer led Feedback</h2>
									<p>Having provided the initial post on the topic of the data collection process, I took the opportunity to explore the work of my colleagues and receive peer led feedback on my own post. I was curious to learn from my peers about the evolution of the internet of things, described as three distinct generations referring to the “tagged things” “the full interconnection of things and the social web of things.” And finally, the age of “social objects, cloud computing and the future internet.” </p>
								        <p>Additionally, I learnt about the the various ways in which data quality could be compromised via a variety of mechanisms including dropped readings, unreliable readings and multi-source data inconstancies. </p>
								        <p>A further interesting point raised by my peers was the importance of considering security challenges faced by the IoT, particularly in relation to the threat of sabotage, privacy concerns and service denial as well as methods to guarantee GDPR compliance.</p>
<h2>Summary Post</h2>	

<p>The Internet of things is a pivotal part of the next generation of technology – it is a conceptual framework that allows for an interconnection for a range of devices and objects, allowing for mass data sharing on an international scale. </p>
<p>The Internet of things is a rapisly growing phenomenon it has at present undergone three iterative process’ including the initial phase which focus concerned Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) which provided identifiers for objects through tags, the next phase involved connecting objects via the internet which could be referred to as the “web of things” and the current phase in which the world of cloud computing and future novel concepts are being explored. (Atzori et al. (2017)</p>									
<p>With the significant volume of data generated through the internet of things it is imperative to have rigorous data cleaning mechanisms in place to ensure high veracity data can be analysed to make real world changes and contributions. Lomet et al. back in 2000 where the need to cover schema-and instance-related data transformations in an integrated way was highlighted.2 Conversely, poor cleaned data can result in inaccurate analysis and poor decision making. </p>								
<p>It is also important to consider the security ramifications of such a far-reaching data sharing project. It has been considered that 5 key questions should be sought to be answered these include where the data will be stored, what personal data will be stored, who and why has the rights to the data access and when does the data transfer take place. It is crucial that these facets are taken into consideration when designing data pipelines within such a system and including them in future iterations (Allegue, 2020).</p>								
<p>To summarise the Internet of things represents a new frontier in a better connected, data driven world; it also however presents the challenge of striking a balance between sheer data volume and data quality as well as issues surrounding data security and GDPR – the challenge of ensuring data quality can be overcome with a rigorous data cleaning strategy. </p>
