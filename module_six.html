									<h2> 1000 word module reflection which will cover the following: </h2> 
									<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

<li>Your knowledge of the different data extraction, exploration, cleaning and modelling techniques you have covered in this module.</li>

<li>Your individual contributions to the team activities</li>

<li>Your experience as a member of a development team.</li>

<li>The impact on your professional/personal development.</li>

									</ul>



<p> This section will overview my reflections of Module 3. It will be written using the Rolfe et. Al (2001) Framework.</p>
<p>My background is entirely non-technical; however, working in medicine there is a growing need to have a deep understanding of data, how it can be both used for the advancement of medical science and abused at the detriment of the patient. It is for this reason that I have undertaken this PGCert in Data Science, empowering me to truly “Decipher Big Data”: gaining a deep understanding of how to assess veracity, discern source reliability and wrangle through high volumes of data. Professionally this will enable me to develop as a researcher in evidence based medicine.  </p>
<p>The first two units of this module provided an overview of the data management pipeline, I found it particularly interesting reading academic literature on the topic including Huxley et.al(2020) which helped to debunk previously held misconceptions relating to the size and the quality of data and how these concepts can determine significance when trying to answer questions. The lecturecast clearly detailed the process of the data management pipeline, using easy to comprehend terminology that was appropriate for me given my lack of previous experience in this area. The collaborative discussion associated with these units involved writing a 300-word critical evaluation on the Internet of things. This is a concept that I had briefly come across in the first module, and consequently had a very limited understanding. This exercise taught me the importance of searching, reviewing and selecting academic sources – I primarily used google scholar and open Athens to achieve this. I found the peer led comments particularly useful for two reasons: firstly, it provided a new perspective on my work, asking questions that prompted me to think further about the subject area in hand and consequently conduct further research into Chu et al. (2016) into Big Data Cleaning. Secondly, the peer led format enabled me to appreciate how different people will interpret the same question in various ways depending on their professional background and experience with the subject matter; consequently, I was able to learn new concepts from my more technically minded colleagues. </p>
<p>For the first team we assignment with were tasked to submit a project report on database design. The positive aspects of our team was the variation in background (Medicine, Finance and education), this enabled us to consider multiple facets when determining appropriate content. There was also a variation in technical ability with one team mate having some prior knowledge of database design. One significant limitation was organising meetings at a mutually convenient time for all group members, owing to varying work commitments, in the future it would be beneficial to block book all required meetings over the 5-week project course, ensuring these dates are committed to. We scored, 58% for the assignment, with constructive feedback describing a lack of critical discussion owing to a lack of formalised citations - feedback that I accept and recognise. I believe the route cause of this limitation is the overreliance on a hypothetical situation, instead of choosing a company with more readily publicly available data at hand. This limitation demonstrates how decisions made in the early planning phase of an assignment can have tangible impact upon the rest of the work. If repeating this assignment therefore I would denote further time in the initial meeting to due diligence in company selection. There was also feedback delivered on the application of the data pipeline in terms of theories relevant to the module material. This criticism could have been overcome by making more effective use of the resources at hand provided by the University.</p>									
<p>The second half of the module involved work on constructing normalised databases, issues of compliance, API and back-up recovery procedures. The tasks involved formatting a database in normalised form, constructing a database and writing critical analysis pieces on API and back-up procedures. The technical tasks were challenging and involved having review lecturecast materials and use self-directed learning techniques to explore more on how to format in normal form and build relational database schema. The collaborative discussion element involved comparing the issue of data regulation compliance between GDPR and an individual country. I found this task particularly interesting, as it revealed the intrinsic link between political discourse and the manner in which this can affect data management. Through my research into the topic area, I learned how non-compliant data management can have devastating affects on large swathes of the population. Reading the responses of my peers enabled me to appreciate how attitudes towards data and the public perception varies depending on cultural and geopolitical background. To improve in future tasks, I would endeavour to include more sources from more analytical backgrounds rather than organisational publication in order to broaden the range of opinions when assessing the impact. </p>								</div>
<p>The second group task involves the production of an executive summary for the logical database design, from assignment 1. In response to the feedback, we received previously we made adjustments to our way of working and the manner in which we planned to approach the task. We decided to work more collaboratively, scheduled blocks of two hours to tackle the same part of the task together. This helped with the flow and structure of the assignment, ensuring that all parts followed on logically and omitted the risk of repletion. We also decided to commit a greater focus to including academic sources to support our rationale for decision made relating to compliance and database design. One significant limitation was work flow delegation, unfortunately one member of our team was undergoing a particularly busy period with work and consequently a larger burden fell upon myself and the other group member. Unfortunately, this is a facet of collaborative work for which there is often no practical solution. In the future however, I would ensure that meetings were scheduled at a more appropriate time and attempt to create a culture whereby people feel comfortable expressing any difficulties they may have with certain tasks so other members can be aware in advanced. </p>
<p>To summarise this Module has provided me with a foundational understanding of the database pipeline management, the process of data wrangling, the construction of databases and the regulatory aspects surrounding practical implementation. The main area I wish to improve on is the technical side concerning actually producing workable code that can be used with wrangling – this is something I will work towards in my own time through working through the “Data Wrangling with python” textbook. Additionally, I I were to complete this module again, I would ensure it was scheduled for a time when I was less busy with work commitments as this provide me with the opportunity to attend more seminar sessions and deepen leaning through peer interaction.  </p>
