										<h1>Secure Software Development</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>In this module, we’ll take an in depth look at the security risks which are associated with programming languages, from the perspectives of design and architecture approaches, programming paradigms, testing, the impact and implications of operating systems and libraries on software development, the security risks associated with distributed systems and APIs, and future trends in secure software and systems design. Running through these topics will be the concept of the secure software development life cycle.</h2>
									
									<h2> Summarising this modules studies </h2> 
									<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

<li> In Week one we learned about different approaches to software development, focusing on implications of secure software. </li>

<li> In Week two we looked at UML diagramming, and the benefits of this documentation towards software development.</li>

<li>In Week three we focused on programming language, with a particular focus on reviewing the history and concepts of programming languages. </li>

<li> In Week four investigated and explored the effect of key programming concepts on system security. We focused on two concepts in particular: regular expressions and recursion.</li> 

<li> In Week five we explored testing software both for general quality and, specific to this module, for security.</li>

<li> In Week six we looked at Python code development and particularly applying linters to support quality code development </li>

<li> In Week seven we discussed Operating Systems (OS) and their relationships to programming languages and security.</li>

<li> In Week eight we looked at Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems. </li>

<li> In Week nine we learned about developing an API for a Distributed Environment. </li>

<li> In Week ten we explored the evolution of system architectures, from distributed systems to microservices.</li>

<li> In Week eleven we looked at future trends in the areas of secure design, development, programming languages and operating systems. </li>

									<h3>Team Discussion: What is a Secure Programming Language? </h3>
									
									<p> 1. What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</p>
<p> Many languages are prone to issues because the languages haven’t been built with modern issues in mind (Pillai, 2017; Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.). For example, C is prone to error handling issues, whereas Python has built-in handlers that will stop the program in the event of faulty code (Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.).</p>

<p>PHP is prone to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) errors (a type of injection attack). As an early language designed for websites, the functionality did not keep up with the distributed nature of modules and code from open source software libraries (Php.net, 2019; Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.)</p>

<p>The general trend is that over time, environments and purposes for language use change. This presents new challenges not anticipated when the languages were originally created.</p>


<p>2. Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</p>
<p>Due to its built-in error handling for many fatal errors and its track record to date, Python could be considered a relatively secure language (Pillai, 2017; Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.). It is not a perfect solution, and newer languages such as Rust extend Python’s security features even further through enhanced error reporting and memory management (Abiodun, 2022).</p>


<p>3. Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</p>
<p>Research indicates that Python is too slow to serve as an operating system language, and that a lower-level language like C would be more effective in this role (Abiodun, 2022). The downfall is that designing an operating system in C would likely require an extraordinary amount of testing to ensure stability and security.</p>
