										<h1>Database Design and Normalisation</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>In this module, we will  look at database design and normalisation, paying particular attention to the formation of a relational database and how it is constructed and broken down into a normalised method for the storage and retrieval of data.As well as un-normalised table and break it down into 1NF, 2NF and 3NF, demonstrating each step taken.</h2>
									
									<h2> Summarising this modules studies: </h2> 
									<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

<li>Examine data cleaning with the use of Python examples</li>

<li>Create data files and convert data sets to CSV format.</li>

<li>Scrape appropriate web pages.</li>

<li>Evaluate how Python scripts (codes) can be created for automating the cleaning process.</li> 

<li>Evaluate how automation uses machine learning strategies.</li>

<li>Understand the use of database representation and architecture. </li>

<li>Evaluate how the cleaning methods help with the storage of useable datasets </li>

<li> Understand how a database is created and how it is linked with the use of key fields. </li>

<li> Analyse anomalies and how they can affect the integrity of the database. </li>

<li> Look at normalisation and the reasoning behind the use of different normal forms.</li>

<li> Examine data attributes, associations, operations and relationships. </li>

<li>Normalise a set of data and Identify constraints associated with the application of the data attributes. </li>

<li> Construct a relational database model based on normalised data </li>

<li> Test the database to check for any errors or anomalies. </li>
									
									</ul>
									
									<h2>Normalisation Task</h2> 
									<h3> Below you will see a table with data in un-normalised form. You should normalise this data to 3rd Normal Form (3NF), showing each step of the process i.e., demonstrating 1NF, 2NF and 3NF. </h3>

									 <p> <img src="images/unit7excelgraph.png"> </p>
									
<p> In order to represent Data in the First Normalised form it is important that attributes consist of atomic values with no data repetition – in practice this means that each cell should contain a single indivisible value. The Data must be split into multiple tables with each row containing a primary key acting as a unique identifier. Looking at this data, we can split it up into the following tables: Students, Courses, Exam Details, Exam Boards, and Teachers. As shown below: </p>

									<p> <img src="images/unit7tab1.png"></p>

<p>Teacher attributes in first Normal Form:</p>
									<p> <img src="images/unit7tab2.png"></p>

<p>Course attributes in first Normal Form:</p>
									<p> <img src="images/unit7tab3.png"></p>

<p>The exam details table can be further split up into additional tables which will represent the second normal form. First a table representing student courses in second normal form can be created:</p>

									<p> <img src="images/unit7tab5.png"></p>

<p>This data can be further condensed into the 3rd Normal form as represented in the table below, for both course details-teacher dteails and exam board details:</p>

									<p> <img src="images/unit7tab6.png"></p>

<p>Course attributes in first Normal Form:</p>

									<p> <img src="images/unit7tab7.png"></p>

									</ul>
									
									<h3>Relational Database Design Task</h3> 

<p>The second Task was to produce a relational database. A relational database structures data organised in tables with predefined relationships among them. Each table represents a specific entity, and rows within the table represent individual records, while columns define the attributes of those records. Relationships are established through keys, ensuring data integrity and consistency. In this case each table contains a primary key which acts as an anchor to a foreign key in a related table as demonstrated below:</p>

									<h3>MICROKERNAL LEAST-PRIVILEGE-TEAM RESPONSE</h3>
									
									<p>In 2022, microkernel architectures offer superior stability and reliability to monolithic systems by modularising operating system processes (Foote, 2021; Fritzsch et al., 2019). However, Linus Torvalds rightly points out that an academically superior solution is useless when it is poorly developed, does not adhere to standards, and lacks community support (DiBona et al., 1999). Linux communities abound, and Linux has served as the underlying technology behind popular operating systems such as Android and ChromeOS due to its portability and ability to maximise system performance (Hoffman, 2017; Vaughan-Nichols, 2019). Linus Torvalds also acknowledges that the merits of system architectures reflect the technologies available (DiBone et al., 1999). With the era of quantum computing fast approaching, monolithic architectures may re-emerge as the best way to harness new-found computational power until another advancement enables better distribution of processing tasks; alternately, the inverse could also be true (Khan et al., 2022).</p>

									 <h3>A reflection of the development process based on your learning in this module, as well as your experience as a member of a development team (e.g., work allocation, experience of different roles, experience of team meetings and so on). </h3>
									 <p>Throughout this module I worked as part of the team of least privilege with Rob, Tinashe, Aaron and James. We initially worked on a design document for our secure web application called ‘First4Aid’, and following this, over a number of weeks we built the application and worked towards our presentation demo back to our tutor. While initially I was nervous about being part of a team, I quickly realised so much was to be gained and I was very lucky with the team that I worked with. 
<p>I put faith into my skills as a business analyst and lead a requirements session on the 01 July. On this session I focused on the WHAT (what are we building) and the WHY (why do we need it). We also spent some time on this call working on a mind map. Essentially, we mapped a brain dump of the requirements we felt our application would need, alongside closely keeping an eye on the assignment security requirements. This aided us with staying on track as we moved through development. 
We prioritized our features using the MoSCoW method. Must have / Should have / Could have / Will not have. </p>
										 
<p>We discussed what tools we would use to aid us in communicating and keeping on schedule. We agreed on Trello for planning and dividing tasks, Teams for communication, and Confluence for document collaboration.
We decided to make 2PM every Friday our regular time slot to catch-up. This gave us structure to our studies and time to dedicate to our team project.</p>
<p>As part of the development, I also enjoyed helping out with test scenarios. I used the BDD style of GIVEN WHEN THEN to help us test the First4Aid application.
Throughout the last number of weeks, I have learnt a lot from working with my team. I learnt what my strengths were in a team dynamic and where I need to improve.   </p>
