									<p>In this module, students will contextualise and
develop information systems using object-oriented
approaches with various programming languages,
such as Python and SQL. This involves equipping
students with the practical skills required to be able
to analyse an information system problem, design
and implement a solution using various industry
standard tools and techniques. </p>
